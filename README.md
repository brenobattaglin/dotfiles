# dotfiles

This is my personal macOS dotfiles. Based and inspired on <a href="https://github.com/holman/dotfiles">holman does dotfiles</a>.

## Getting Started

1. Update the files located on the git folder with your name and email.
2. Run the scripts, the Makefile contains macros so the process becomes easier.

## Manual checklist

This is my personal checklist after the setup is done:

- [ ] Sign in on VS Code using GitHub Account
- [ ] Sign in on VS Code's GitHub Copilot using GitHub Account
- [ ] Sign in on VS Code's Gitlens using GitHub Account

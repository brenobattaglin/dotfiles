# dotfiles

This is my personal macOS dotfiles. Based and inspired on <a href="https://github.com/holman/dotfiles">holman does dotfiles</a>.

## Getting Started

1. Update the files located on the git folder with your name and email.
2. Run the scripts, the Makefile contains macros so the process becomes easier. You'll be prompted sometimes during the installs or setups to input the password, so I recommend to follow up the process.

## Manual checklist

This is my personal checklist after the setup is done:

- [ ] Sign in on VS Code using GitHub Account
- [ ] Sign in on VS Code's GitHub Copilot using GitHub Account
- [ ] Sign in on VS Code's Gitlens using GitHub Account
